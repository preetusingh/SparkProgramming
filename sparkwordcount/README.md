##Objective: Implementation of WordCount using Spark application with Scala IDE and Maven 

####Download Scala IDE:- 
Scala IDE is an eclipse project which provides a very intuitive development environment for Scala and Spark application. Download Scala IDE and install it.  

####Create a Maven project:-
Maven is a popular package management tool for Java-based languages that allows us to link libraries present in public repositories.We can use Maven itself to build our project, or use other tools like Scalaâ€™s sbt tool or Gradle.

1. Go to: File-> New -> Project -> Maven project  and create a maven project.Fill Group Id and Artifact Id & click finish. 
Group Id = org.test and Artifact Id = sparkwordcount

2. Update pom.xml:- Download pom.xml sample and update it in above maven project. It has spark dependency jar entry which will be downloaded while building. 

3. Add Scala Nature to this project :- 
Right click on project -> configure - > Add Scala Nature. 

4. Update Scala compiler version for Spark:- 
Scala IDE by default uses latest version(2.11) of Scala compiler, however Spark uses version 2.10.So we need to update appropriate version for IDE. 
Right click on project- > Go to properties -> Scala compiler -> update Scala installation version to 2.10.5 
  
5. Remove Scala Library Container from build path :- (Optional)
Jars required in already added via spark core(via pom.xml), so multiple jars is not required.
Right click on the project -> Build path -> Configure build path  and remove Scala Library Container.

6. Update source folder src/main/java to src/main/scala (Right click -> Refactor -> Rename  to scala).Now create a package under this name it as com.devinline.spark.

7. Create a Scala object under package created above name it as WordCount.scala
Right click on package -> New -> Scala Object  and add WordCount at the end of Name.

9. Create an input file in project named as Food.txt and enter some words into it. 

10. Execute WordCount program :-  Right click on WordCount.scala - > Run as -> Scala application. It should create an output directory output.txt  and it should contain two file : part-00000 and _SUCCESS.
Sample output is part-00000.
